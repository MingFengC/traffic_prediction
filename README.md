# Traffic Density Prediction from LTA Images & Speedbands
Currently a work in progress! This is a project for DSA3101 (Data Science in Practice)

## Background
Based on traffic images and speedbands obtained from LTA Datamall (https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html), we estimate the traffic density and recommend users if they should travel along a certain road for a chosen specific day & time range

## Workflow Overview
1. Image Enhancement
2. Selecting ROI for Traffic Images
3. Vehicle Detection for Traffic Images
4. Model for Traffic Prediction
